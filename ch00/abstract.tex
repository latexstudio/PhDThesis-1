Automatically describing different aspects of digital music content is nowadays crucial for organizing, searching and interrelating large volumes of diverse music collections. Melody is a fundamental dimension in most music traditions, and therefore, is an indispensable component in their description. With its complex melodic structures and well-grounded theory \gls{iam} provides an opportunity to push the boundaries of the current knowledge in \gls{mir}. Being a socio-cultural product, melody necessitates culture-aware methodologies for its analysis. However, melodic analysis in \gls{iam} remains largely underinvestigated by the current computational methodologies in \gls{mir}. This thesis addresses computational analysis of melodies in \gls{iam} to automatically describe and characterize its melodic structures directly from audio music recordings. 

To this end, we build a sizable data corpora that is representative of the real-world music collections of \gls{iam}, using which we develop our data-driven approaches. We provide a detailed documentation of this process, and also elaborate different test datasets that we use in our work. Tonic pitch in performances of \gls{iam} varies across artists and their recordings, and therefore, its estimation becomes a necessary first step for a meaningful melodic analysis.  We study the existing tonic identification methods in depth and perform a comprehensive comparative evaluation on sizable datasets to identify the most reliable method to be used in our work. In order to segment the stable note regions in a melody, a landmark that demarcates relevant patterns, we propose a machine learning based approach that shows promising results. Subsequently, we focus on the main tasks of melodic pattern discovery and raga recognition. 

Recurring patterns are the building blocks of melodic structures in both improvisation and composition, and thus, are instrumental in the description of \gls{iam}. We propose an unsupervised approach and employ time-series analysis tools to discover such musically significant melodic patterns in sizable audio music collections. Due to the challenges involved in a quantitative evaluation of such approaches, we first carry out an in-depth study of  melodic similarity, which is a critical component in pattern discovery, in a supervised setup. We improve upon the best methodology for melodic similarity that we identify through an exhaustive evaluation of different procedures and their parameter settings that are well known and widely used for this task. Our proposed approach exploits domain specificity by utilizing peculiar characteristics of melodies in \gls{iam}. Computational pattern discovery approaches typically result in large amount of musically trivial patterns. We propose an approach to identify the musically significant patterns by characterizing them using network analysis that exploits the interaction between the patterns. Listening tests reveal that the discovered melodic patterns from this approach are musically interesting and significant.

Raga is a core musical concepts in \gls{iam} used in composition, performance, music organization, and pedagogy, and therefore, the most desired melodic description of a music recording. We propose two novel approaches for raga recognition that jointly model the tonal and the temporal aspects of melody. Our first approach is based on melodic patterns, the most prominent cues for raga identification by humans. For this, we utilize the discovered melodic patterns and employ topic modeling techniques, in which we regard a \gls{raga} rendition similar to a textual description of a topic. In our second approach we propose the \gls{tdms}, a novel feature based on delay coordinates that captures the melodic outline of a \gls{raga}. With these approaches we demonstrate unprecedented accuracies in \gls{raga} recognition on the largest datasets ever used for this task.  Although our approach is guided by the characteristics of melodies in \gls{iam} and the task at hand, we believe our methodology can be easily extended to other melody dominant music traditions.
	
The data and tools developed in this work can be used for a number of computational studies in \gls{iam}, specifically in pattern-based characterization of ragas, compositions and artists. The technologies resulting from this research work are a part of a number of applications developed within the CompMusic project for a better description, enhanced listening experience, and pedagogy in \gls{iam}.
