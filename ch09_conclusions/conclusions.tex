%
%I am writing future work and possible conclusions in random order as they come 
%
%We wont go very far with an unsupervised approach without the mechanism of evaluating it. But if the annotation process was not tricky we would be using supervised. So a balanced approach would be to use discovery methods to generate evaluatino set and bootstrap the process. 
%
%Phrase boundary extension collectively within a community of phrases...to study a common defining length
%
%Exploiting melodic context in discovering and detecting phrases
%
%Exploiting if melodic characteristic of he phrase can tell us something about the phrase category
%
%Incorpotating segmentation models or using methods that does not require segmentation.
%
%In the future we plan to include other aspects of melody such as loudness and timbre in the similarity computation and use a bigger dataset consisting of many more melodic patterns for evaluation.
%.
%
%In the future, we plan to investigate if both these methodologies can be successfully combined to improve r\={a}ga recognition.
%
%Hierarchical raga recognition model
%
%Temporally minimum duration needed
%
%INdexing techniques.
