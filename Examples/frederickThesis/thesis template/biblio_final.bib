	Abstract = {Power laws are theoretically interesting probability distributions that are also frequently used to describe empirical data. In recent years, effective statistical methods for fitting power laws have been developed, but appropriate use of these techniques requires significant programming and statistical insight. In order to greatly decrease the barriers to using good statistical methods for fitting power law distributions, we developed the powerlaw Python package. This software package provides easy commands for basic fitting and statistical analysis of distributions. Notably, it also seeks to support a variety of user needs by being exhaustive in the options available to the user. The source code is publicly available and easily extensible.},

	Abstract = {The usability and the strong social dimension of the Web2.0 applications has encouraged users to create, annotate and share their content thus leading to a rich and content intensive Web. Despite that, the Web2.0 content lacks the explicit semantics that would allow it to be used in large scale intelligent applications. At the same time the advances in Semantic Web technologies imply a promising potential for intelligent applications capable to integrate distributed content and knowledge from various heterogeneous resources. We present FLOR a tool that performs semantic enrichment of folksonomy tagspaces by exploiting online ontologies, thesauri and other knowledge sources.},

@inproceedings{Ballan2010,
	Abstract = {Nowadays, almost any web site that provides means for sharing user-generated multimedia content, like Flickr, Facebook, YouTube and Vimeo, has tagging functionalities to let users annotate the material that they want to share. The tags are then used to retrieve the uploaded content, and to ease browsing and exploration of these collections, e.g. using tag clouds. However, while tagging a single image is straightforward, and sites like Flickr and Facebook allow also to tag easily portions of the uploaded photos, tagging a video sequence is more cumbersome, so that users just tend to tag the overall content of a video. Moreover, the tagging process is completely manual, and often users tend to spend as few time as possible to annotate the material, resulting in a sparse annotation of the visual content. A semi-automatic process, that helps the users to tag a video sequence would improve the quality of annotations and thus the overall user experience. While research on image tagging has received a considerable attention in the latest years, there are still very few works that address the problem of automatically assigning tags to videos, locating them temporally within the video sequence. In this paper we present a system for video tag suggestion and temporal localization based on collective knowledge and visual similarity of frames. The algorithm suggests new tags that can be associated to a given keyframe exploiting the tags associated to videos and images uploaded to social sites like YouTube and Flickr and visual features.},

	Abstract = {We present Essentia 2.0, an open-source C++ library for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval released under the Affero GPL license. It contains an extensive collection of reusable algorithms which implement audio input/output functionality, standard digital signal processing blocks, statistical characterization of data, and a large set of spectral, temporal, tonal and high-level music descriptors. The library is also wrapped in Python and includes a number of predefined executable extractors for the available music descriptors, which facilitates its use for fast prototyping and allows setting up research experiments very rapidly. Furthermore, it includes a Vamp plugin to be used with Sonic Visualiser for visualization purposes. The library is cross-platform and currently supports Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows systems. Essentia is designed with a focus on the robustness of the provided music descriptors and is optimized in terms of the computational cost of the algorithms. The provided functionality, specifically the music descriptors included in-the-box and signal processing algorithms, is easily expandable and allows for both research experiments and development of large-scale industrial applications.},

	Abstract = {<?Pub Dtl?>Measuring music similarity is essential for multimedia retrieval. For music items, this task can be regarded as obtaining a suitable distance measurement between songs defined on a certain feature space. In this paper, we propose three of such distance measures based on the audio content: first, a low-level measure based on tempo-related description; second, a high-level semantic measure based on the inference of different musical dimensions by support vector machines. These dimensions include genre, culture, moods, instruments, rhythm, and tempo annotations. Third, a hybrid measure which combines the above-mentioned distance measures with two existing low-level measures: a Euclidean distance based on principal component analysis of timbral, temporal, and tonal descriptors, and a timbral distance based on single Gaussian Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) modeling. We evaluate our proposed measures against a number of baseline measures. We do this objectively based on a comprehensive set of music collections, and subjectively based on listeners' ratings. Results show that the proposed methods achieve accuracies comparable to the baseline approaches in the case of the tempo and classifier-based measures. The highest accuracies are obtained by the hybrid distance. Furthermore, the proposed classifier-based approach opens up the possibility to explore distance measures that are based on semantic notions.},

	Abstract = {Most of the current methodologies for building ontologies rely on specialized knowledge engineers. This is in contrast to real-world settings, where the need for maintenance of domain specific ontologies emerges in the daily work of users. But in order to allow for participatory ontology engineering, we need to have a more realistic conceptual model of how ontologies develop in the real world. We introduce the ontology maturing processes which is based on the insight that ontology engineering is a collaborative informal learning process and for which we analyze characteristic evolution steps and triggers that have users engage in ontology engineering within their everyday work processes. This model integrates tagging and folksonomies with formal ontologies and shows maturing pathways between them. As implementations of this model, we present two case studies and the corresponding tools. The first is about image-based ontology engineering (introducing so-called imagenotions), the second about ontology-enabled social bookmarking (SOBOLEO). Both of them are inspired by lightweight Web 2.0 approaches and allow for realtime collaboration.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/ To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from 3 years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine - the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections, where anyone can publish anything they want. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Online photo albums have been prevalent in recent years and have resulted in more and more applications developed to provide convenient functionalities for photo sharing. In this paper, we propose a system named SheepDog to automatically add photos into appropriate groups and recommend suitable tags for users on Flickr. We adopt concept detection to predict relevant concepts of a photo and probe into the issue about training data collection for concept classification. From the perspective of gathering training data by web searching, we introduce two mechanisms and investigate their performances of concept detection. Based on some existing information from Flickr, a ranking-based method is applied not only to obtain reliable training data, but also to provide reasonable group/tag recommendations for input photos. We evaluate this system with a rich set of photos and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our work.},

	Abstract = {Web photos in social media sharing websites such as Flickr are generally accompanied by rich but noisy textual descriptions (tags, captions, categories, etc.). In this paper, we proposed a tag-based photo retrieval framework to improve the retrieval performance for Flickr photos by employing a novel batch mode re-tagging method. The proposed batch mode re-tagging method can automatically refine noisy tags of a group of Flickr photos uploaded by the same user within a short period by leveraging millions of training web images and their associated rich textual descriptions. Specifically, for one group of Flickr photos, we construct a group-specific lexicon which contains only the tags of all photos within the group. For each query tag, we employ the inverted file method to automatically find loosely labeled training web images. We propose a SVM with Augmented Features, referred to as AFSVM, to learn adapted classifiers to refine the annotation tags of photos by leveraging the existing SVM classifiers of popular tags, which are associated with a large amount of positive training web images. Moreover, to further refine the annotation tags of photos in the same group, we additionally introduce an objective function that utilizes the visual similarities of photos within the group as well as the semantic proximities of their tags. Based on the refined tags, photos can be retrieved according to more reliable relevance scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

Evidence from the diverse, yet completely relevant arenas of controlled research and the working world of influence professionals is examined in light of six basic (and very powerful) principles of psychology that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. The ideal supplement for students of psychology, management, sales, marketing, and persuasion, and a fascinating read for anyone interested in the power and tactics of influence, this text demonstrates how influence affects our daily lives and offers "defense" sections that show how to resist undue influence.

	Abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

In an effective photo management system photo annotation is the most challenging task. In this paper, we develop several innovative interaction techniques for semi-automatic photo annotation. Compared with traditional annotation systems, our approach provides the following new features: ``cluster annotation'' puts similar faces or photos with similar scene together, and enables user label them in one operation; ``contextual re-ranking'' boosts the labeling productivity by guessing the user intention; ``ad hoc annotation'' allows user label photos while they are browsing or searching, and improves system performance progressively through learning propagation. Our results show that these technologies provide a more user friendly interface for the annotation of person name, location, and event, and thus substantially improve the annotation performance especially for a large photo album.},

	Abstract = {In Chapter 4, the author examines the different explanations for the big size of the brain in primates. The first explanation is that fruit rich diets, like primates have, need colour vision to perceive fruits from leaves, and that requires computing space: this explanation was advanced in the '70s, and holds. The '80s have added the machiavellian Intelligence hypothesys, stating that bigger brain size is needed to handle social behaviour complexity. This, while appealing, has not really been tested. So, to check its validity, the author maps the neocortex to total brain ration (neocortex is the site of the higher brain functions) with grop size, and it holds for primates, as well as for carnivores. Two factors might account for it: handling more reations or deepening the relations. Operationalising this as grooming, the results this latter thesis, suggesting that humans should live in coalitions of about 150 people. What follows is an attempt to prove that 1500 is indeed a magic, recurring number in human history, including tribes, milatry companies, businesses, etc. What remains to be proven is how do humans manage 150 people, given that grooming would be too much: the author's answer is through gossip, that allows a one-to-many grooming relationship to develop.},

	Abstract = {User generated content shared in online communities is often described using collaborative tagging systems where users assign labels to content resources. As a result, a folksonomy emerges that relates a number of tags with the resources they label and the users that have used them. In this paper we analyze the folksonomy of Freesound, an online audio clip sharing site which contains more than two million users and 150,000 user-contributed sound samples covering a wide variety of sounds. By following methodologies taken from similar studies, we compute some metrics that characterize the folksonomy both at the global level and at the tag level. In this manner, we are able to better understand the behavior of the folksonomy as a whole, and also obtain some indicators that can be used as metadata for describing tags themselves. We expect that such a methodology for characterizing folksonomies can be useful to support processes such as tag recommendation or automatic annotation of online resources.},

	Abstract = {Semantic annotation enables the development of efficient computational methods for analyzing and interacting with information, thus maximizing its value. With the already substantial and constantly expanding data generation capacity of the life sciences as well as the concomitant increase in the knowledge distributed in scientific articles, new ways to produce semantic annotations of this information are crucial. While automated techniques certainly facilitate the process, manual annotation remains the gold standard in most domains. In this manuscript, we describe a prototype mass-collaborative semantic annotation system that, by distributing the annotation workload across the broad community of biomedical researchers, may help to produce the volume of meaningful annotations needed by modern biomedical science. We present E.D., the Entity Describer, a mashup of the Connotea social tagging system, an index of semantic web-accessible controlled vocabularies, and a new public RDF database for storing social semantic annotations.},

In this paper, we propose a triadic approach for mining folksonomies based on hierarchical classes analysis, and demonstrate how triadic elements of folksonomies can be analyzed and mined by applying the proposed approach. We also discuss how the results can be used for better understanding of the characteristics of folksonomies. Key},

	Abstract = {In this work we explore the trade-offs in acquiring training data for image classification models through automated web search as opposed to human annotation. Automated web search comes at no cost in human labor, but sometimes leads to decreased classification performance, while human annotations come at great expense in human labor but result in better performance. The primary contribution of this work is a system for predicting which visual concepts will show the greatest increase in performance from investing human effort in obtaining annotations. We propose to build this system as an estimation of the absolute gain in average precision (AP) experienced from using human annotations instead of web search. To estimate the AP gain, we rely on statistical classifiers built on top of a number of quality prediction features. We employ a feature selection algorithm to compare the quality of each of the predictors and find that cross-domain image similarity and cross-domain model generalization metrics are strong predictors, while concept frequency and within-domain model quality are weak predictors. In a test application, we find that the prediction scheme can result in a savings in annotation effort of up to 75\%, while only incurring marginal damage (10 \% relative decrease in mean average precision) to the overall performance of the concept models.},

@article{Kim2010,
	Abstract = {A growing number of tagging applications have begun to provide users the ability to socialise their own keywords. Tagging, which assigns a set of keywords to resources, has become a powerful way for organising, browsing, and publicly sharing personal collections of resources on the Web. It is called folksonomies. These systems on current social websites, however, have deficiencies in defining tag's meaning, and are often blocked to users in order to reuse, share, and exchange the tags across heterogeneous websites. In this paper, we describe a semantic model for expressing folksonomies in social websites. This model, called Social Semantic Cloud of Tags, aims to provide a consistent format of representing folksonomies and some features in terms of tagging activities. We describe core concepts and relevant properties such as a popularity and usage of tags, along with deduced relationships between tags. We will discuss how this model helps to reduce drawbacks regarding tag sharing between users, applications, or folksonomies.

	Abstract = {Descriptive tags are needed to enable efficient and effective search in vast collections of images. Tag recommendation represents a trade-off between automatic image annotation techniques and manual tagging. In this letter, we formulate image tag recommendation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, making use of a visual folksonomy. A folksonomy can be seen as a collaboratively created set of metadata for informal social classification. Our experimental results show that the use of a visual folksonomy for image tag recommendation has two significant benefits, compared to a conventional approach using a limited concept vocabulary. First, our tag recommendation technique can make use of an unrestricted and rich concept vocabulary. Second, our approach is able to recommend a higher number of correct tags. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Developing effective methods for automated annotation of digital pictures continues to challenge computer scientists. The capability of annotating pictures by computers can lead to breakthroughs in a wide range of applications, including Web image search, online picture-sharing communities, and scientific experiments. In this work, the authors developed new optimization and estimation techniques to address two fundamental problems in machine learning. These new techniques serve as the basis for the Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures - Real Time (ALIPR) system of fully automatic and high speed annotation for online pictures. In particular, the D2-clustering method, in the same spirit as k-means for vectors, is developed to group objects represented by bags of weighted vectors. Moreover, a generalized mixture modeling technique (kernel smoothing as a special case) for non-vector data is developed using the novel concept of Hypothetical Local Mapping (HLM). ALIPR has been tested by thousands of pictures from an Internet photo-sharing site, unrelated to the source of those pictures used in the training process. Its performance has also been studied at an online demo site where arbitrary users provide pictures of their choices and indicate the correctness of each annotation word. The experimental results show that a single computer processor can suggest annotation terms in real-time and with good accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Social image analysis and retrieval is important for helping people organize and access the increasing amount of user tagged multimedia. Since user tagging is known to be uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a fundamental problem is how to interpret the relevance of a user-contributed tag with respect to the visual content the tag is describing. Intuitively, if different persons label visually similar images using the same tags, these tags are likely to reflect objective aspects of the visual content. Starting from this intuition, we propose in this paper a neighbor voting algorithm which accurately and efficiently learns tag relevance by accumulating votes from visual neighbors. Under a set of well-defined and realistic assumptions, we prove that our algorithm is a good tag relevance measurement for both image ranking and tag ranking. Three experiments on 3.5 million Flickr photos demonstrate the general applicability of our algorithm in both social image retrieval and image tag suggestion. Our tag relevance learning algorithm substantially improves upon baselines for all the experiments. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is promising for real-world applications.},

The purpose of our model is to be able to describe tags in a very general manner, and as an immediate consequence, to describe tags as modelled by other tag models (SCOT, CommonTag, etc.). Our tag model can thus be seen as a bridge between the manifold conceptualizations and instantiations of tags\{$\backslash$textquoteright\}s models currently available on the Web.},

An important feature of these services is that the users manually annotate their images with the freely- chosen tags, which can be used as indexing keywords for image search and other applications. However, since the tags are generally provided by grassroots Internet users, there is still a gap between these tags and the actual content of the images. This deficiency has significantly limited tag-based applications while, on the other hand, poses a new challenge to the multimedia research community. It calls for a series of research efforts for processing these unqualified tags, especially in making use of content analysis techniques to improve the descriptive power of the tags with respect to the image contents. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the technical achievements in the research area of content-based tag processing for social images, covering the research aspects on tag ranking, tag refinement and tag-to- region assignment. We review the research advances for each topic and present a brief suggestion for future promising directions.},

	Abstract = {Online social media repositories such as Flickr and Zooomr allow users to manually annotate their images with freely- chosen tags, which are then used as indexing keywords to fa- cilitate image search and other applications. However, these tags are frequently imprecise and incomplete, though they are provided by human beings, and many of them are almost only meaningful for the image owners (such as the name of a dog). Thus there is still a gap between these tags and the actual content of the images, and this significantly limits tag- based applications, such as search and browsing. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a social image retagging scheme that aims at assigning images with better content descriptors. The refining process, including denoising and enriching, is formulated as an optimization framework based on the consistency between visual similarity and seman- tic similarity in social images, that is, the visually similar images tend to have similar semantic descriptors, and vice versa. An effective iterative bound optimization algorithm is applied to learn the improved tag assignment. In addi- tion, as many tags are intrinsically not closely-related to the visual content of the images, we employ a knowledge based method to differentiate visual content related tags from un- related ones and then constrain the tagging vocabulary of our automatic algorithm within the content related tags. Fi- nally, to improve the coverage of the tags, we further enrich the tag set with appropriate synonyms and hypernyms based on an external knowledge base. Experimental results on a Flickr image collection demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. We will also show the remarkable performance improvements brought by retagging via two applications, i.e., tag-based search and automatic annotation.},

However, the tags associated with an image generally are in a random order without any importance or relevance information, which limits the effectiveness of these tags in search and other applications. In this paper, we propose a tag ranking scheme, aiming to automatically rank the tags associated with a given image according to their relevance to the image content. We first estimate initial relevance scores for the tags based on probability density estimation, and then perform a random walk over a tag similarity graph to refine the relevance scores. Experimental results on a 50, 000 Flickr photo collection show that the proposed tag ranking method is both effective and efficient. We also apply tag ranking into three applications: (1) tag-based image search, (2) tag recommendation, and (3) group recommendation, which demonstrates that the proposed tag ranking approach really boosts the performances of social-tagging related applications.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we investigate how to propagate annotated labels for a given single image from the image-level to their corresponding semantic regions, namely Label-to-Region (L2R), by utilizing the auxiliary knowledge from Internet image search with the annotated image labels as queries. A nonparametric solution is proposed to perform L2R for single image with complete labels. First, each label of the image is used as query for online image search engines to obtain a set of semantically related and visually similar images, which along with the input image are encoded as Bags-of-Hierarchical-Patches. Then, an efficient two-stage feature mining procedure is presented to discover those input-image specific, salient and descriptive features for each label from the proposed Interpolation SIFT (iSIFT) feature pool. These features consequently constitute a patch-level representation, and the continuity-biased sparse coding is proposed to select few patches from the online images with preference to larger patches to reconstruct a candidate region, which randomly merges the spatially connected patches of the input image. Such candidate regions are further ranked according to the reconstruction errors, and the top regions are used to derive the label confidence vector for each patch of the input image. Finally, a patch clustering procedure is performed as postprocessing to finalize L2R for the input image. Extensive experiments on three public databases demonstrate the encouraging performance of the proposed nonparametric L2R solution.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines user-generated metadata as implemented and applied in two web services designed to share and organize digital media to better understand grassroots classification. Metadata - data about data - allows systems to collocate related information, and helps users find relevant information. The creation of metadata has generally been approached in two ways: professional creation and author creation. In libraries and other organizations, creating metadata, primarily in the form of catalog records, has traditionally been the domain of dedicated professionals working with complex, detailed rule sets and vocabularies. The primary problem with this approach is scalability and its impracticality for the vast amounts of content being produced and used, especially on the World Wide Web. The apparatus and tools built around professional cataloging systems are generally too complicated for anyone without specialized training and knowledge. A second approach is for metadata to be created by authors. The movement towards creator described documents was heralded by SGML, theWWW, and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. There are problems with this approach as well - often due to inadequate or inaccurate description, or outright deception. This paper examines a third approach: user-created metadata, where users of the documents and media create metadata for their own individual use that is also shared throughout a community.},

	Abstract = {Entity Linking (EL) and Word Sense Disam- biguation (WSD) both address the lexical am- biguity of language. But while the two tasks are pretty similar, they differ in a fundamen- tal respect: in EL the textual mention can be linked to a named entity which may or may not contain the exact mention, while inWSDthere is a perfect match between theword form (bet- ter, its lemma) and a suitable word sense. In this paper we present Babelfy, a unified graph-based approach to EL and WSD based on a loose identification of candidate mean- ings coupled with a densest subgraph heuris- tic which selects high-coherence semantic in- terpretations. Our experiments show state-of- the-art performances on both tasks on 6 differ- ent datasets, including a multilingual setting. Babelfy is online at http://babelfy.org 1},

In this paper, we describe an approach that mixes folksonomies and semantic web technologies in order to solve some of these problems, and to enrich information retrieval capabilities among blog posts. We first introduce the corporate context of the study and the issues we have faced that motivated our approach. Then, we argue how the use of domain ontologies combined with the SIOC vocabulary on the top of an existing folksonomy and weblogging platform offers a way to get rid of free-tagging classification flaws, and enhances information retrieval by suggesting related blog posts. Aside of the theoretical background, this paper also focuses on implementation. We present experimental results of this approach through the example of add-ons to a corporate blogging platform and the associated semantic web search engine, that extensively uses RDF and other semantic web technologies to find appropriate information and suggest related posts.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we address the task of recommending additional tags to partially annotated media objects, in our case images. We propose an extendable framework that can recommend tags using a combination of different personalised and collective contexts. We combine information from four contexts: (1) all the photos in the system, (2) a user's own photos, (3) the photos of a user's social contacts, and (4) the photos posted in the groups of which a user is a member. Variants of methods (1) and (2) have been proposed in previous work, but the use of (3) and (4) is novel. For each of the contexts we use the same probabilistic model and Borda Count based aggregation approach to generate recommendations from different contexts into a unified ranking of recommended tags. We evaluate our system using a large set of real-world data from Flickr. We show that by using personalised contexts we can significantly improve tag recommendation compared to using collective knowledge alone. We also analyse our experimental results to explore the capabilities of our system with respect to a user's social behaviour.},

We propose that `information sharing' is best understood as a continuum that concomitantly reflects behavioural, social, economic, legal, and technological influences. `Information' is a hybrid of both `public' and `private' goods. The mechanisms that enable, predict, and catalyse sharing behaviour in online contexts should be of major interest to both scholars and practitioners of knowledge systems. We cite a spectrum of analytical as well as empirical research on the topic of sharing, identifying the methods and theories used in the approaches to date. We also review the major online technology genres of import for sharing. We suggest an initial map of constructs to chart future research on sharing.},

The purpose of the method is to suggest tags that are relevant to the visual content of a given photo at upload time. Both textual and visual cues are used in the process of tag expansion. When a photo is to be uploaded, the system asks for a couple of initial tags from the user. The initial tags are used to retrieve relevant photos together with their tags. These photos are assumed to be potentially content related to the uploaded target photo. The tag sets of the relevant photos are used to form the candidate tag list, and visual similarities between the target photo and relevant photos are used to give weights to these candidate tags. Tags with the highest weights are suggested to the user. The method is applied on Flickr (http://www.flickr.com). Results show that including visual information in the process of photo tagging increases accuracy with respect to text-based methods.},

	Abstract = {Although many species possess rudimentary communication systems, humans seem to be unique with regard to making use of syntax and symbolic reference. Recent approaches to the evolution of language formalize why syntax is selectively advantageous compared with isolated signal communication systems, but do not explain how signals naturally combine. Even more recent work has shown that if a communication system maximizes communicative efficiency while minimizing the cost of communication, or if a communication system constrains ambiguity in a non-trivial way while a certain entropy is maximized, signal frequencies will be distributed according to Zipf's law.

	Abstract = {While tags in collaborative tagging systems serve primarily an indexing purpose, facilitating search and navigation of resources, the use of the same tags by more than one individual can yield a collective classification schema. We present an approach for making explicit the semantics behind the tag space in social tagging systems, so that this collaborative organization can emerge in the form of groups of concepts and partial ontologies. This is achieved by using a combination of shallow pre-processing strategies and statistical techniques together with knowledge provided by ontologies available on the semantic web. Preliminary results on the del.icio.us and Flickr tag sets show that the approach is very promising: it generates clusters with highly related tags corresponding to concepts in ontologies and meaningful relationships among subsets of these tags can be identified.},

The literature on establishing on-line communities and on extending existing platforms with functionalities that enable community building emphasizes the social and economic aspects of community building and neglects the technical aspects. On-line communities have two elements: community members and platform. The platform provides a virtual social meeting space and shapes communication with the service it provides. In order to determine what kind of services will enable, stimulate, and foster community building, this paper identifies community modules and proposes a typology of on-line communities and their community-supporting platforms.

	Abstract = {With rising importance of knowledge interchange, many industrial and academic applications have adopted ontologies as their conceptual backbone. However, industrial and academic environments are very dynamic, thus inducing changes to application requirements. To fulfill these changes, often the underlying ontology must be evolved as well. As ontologies grow in size, the complexity of change management increases, thus requiring a well- structured ontology evolution process. In this paper we identify a possible six- phase evolution process and focus on providing the user with capabilities to control and customize it. We introduce the concept of an evolution strategy encapsulating policy for evolution with respect to user's requirements.},

	Abstract = {Face annotation technology is important for a photo management system. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive face annotation framework combining unsupervised and interactive learning. There are two main contributions in our framework. In the unsupervised stage, a partial clustering algorithm is proposed to find the most evident clusters instead of grouping all instances into clusters, which leads to a good initial labeling for later user interaction. In the interactive stage, an efficient labeling procedure based on minimization of both global system uncertainty and estimated number of user operations is proposed to reduce user interaction as much as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed annotation framework can significantly reduce the face annotation workload and is superior to existing solutions in the literature.},

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained.},

	Abstract = {Microblogging applications such as Twitter are experiencing tremendous success. Twitter users use hashtags to categorize posted messages which aim at bringing order to the chaos of the Twittersphere. However, the percentage of messages including hashtags is very small and the used hashtags are very heterogeneous as hashtags may be chosen freely and may consist of any arbitrary combination of characters. This heterogeneity and the lack of use of hashtags lead to significant drawbacks in regards of the search functionality as messages are not categorized in a homogeneous way. In this paper we present an approach for the recommendation of hashtags suitable for the tweet the user currently enters which aims at creating a more homogeneous set of hashtags. Furthermore, users are encouraged to using hashtags as they are provided with suitable recommendations for hashtags. 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Zhao2010,
	Abstract = {With the proliferation of Web 2.0 applications, user-supplied social tags are commonly available in social media as a means to bridge the semantic gap. On the other hand, the explosive expansion of social web makes an overwhelming number of web videos available, among which there exists a large number of near-duplicate videos. In this paper, we investigate techniques which allow effective annotation of web videos from a data-driven perspective. A novel classifier-free video annotation framework is proposed by first retrieving visual duplicates and then suggesting representative tags. The significance of this paper lies in the addressing of two timely issues for annotating query videos. First, we provide a novel solution for fast near-duplicate video retrieval. Second, based on the outcome of near-duplicate search, we explore the potential that the data-driven annotation could be successful when huge volume of tagged web videos is freely accessible online. Experiments on cross sources (annotating Google videos and Yahoo! videos using YouTube videos) and cross time periods (annotating YouTube videos using historical data) show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed classifier-free approach for web video tag annotation.},
