\chapter{Music corpus and datasets}\label{chap:datasets}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:corpus_intro}

Data is a fundamental requirement in the development of information retrieval technologies\TODO{ref}. A research corpora is a collection of data compiled to study a specific research problem. A well designed research corpora is representative of the domain under study used for the development and evaluation of approaches (???). 

Since its practically infeasible to work with the entire universe of data, specially in the context of the multimedia owing to differnt challenges including copyright issues, 

In \gls{mir} a considerable number of the computational approaches follow a data-driven methodology, and hence, a well curated research corpora becomes a key factor in determining the success of these approaches. 

Due to the importance of a good representative corpora in research in general, the criterion for designing a such a research corpora becomes a fundamental task in itself.





Before we proceed further a distinction should be made between a research corpus and specific datasets


 


\begin{itemize}
	\item Data is needed for dev of MIR approaches
	\item MIR is primarily a data driven field
	\item How should be the research corpus used for these approaches
	\item What are the components of these corpus, how its used, in which modes
	\item How does it develop
	\item How is it curated/selected/ what should be the criterions. 
	\item Issue of reproducibility in research, sharable corpus, open access corpus
	\item examples of researhc corporas 
	\item openly available corporas
	
\end{itemize}
